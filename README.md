# All about Make


***Makefile*** isn't really a necessary skill if you wanna stick to smaller projects or just love choas in your life. but however small the project. Makefiles makes it easier and cleaner to deal with ypur project. i never understood Make, so this is me documenting to make life easier and learn by practicing. all the Makefiles will be in their own respective folders. you can clone the repo to your system and the examples yourselves.
